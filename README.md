# Dota2AI2016
Captures screen and translates to virtual keyboard and mouse output. Since the release of the Dota 2 Bot API, this is no longer necessary for cutting-edge work.

### Things which may be applicable to your projects:
- get_image.py has a very fast screen capture to numpy array function.
- classifiers.py has a very fast screen-parsing function.
- user_input.py has a successful integration of uinput (disable mouse acceleration for best results).

### Licensing notes:
- I do not own the copyright to Dota 2 or Hypatia Sans, which remain copyright by their respective owners.
- If requested, I can release the other elements of this project under a more permissive license.
